# README

kube_dashboard is a simple aws interface to manage kubernetes clusters and resources. For now is just a project that I use for practice.
The end goal is to get better in Ruby and React.

## Run Capybara and rspec tests 

```bash
  be rspec
```

## Run JavaScript tests 

```jest
  npm test
```
